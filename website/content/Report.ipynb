In other words, they are more independent of other economics to do well in order for them to do well. \n\n- We see that the US is by far the most independent of the 11 countries. This concurs with our conclusion because US is a consuming imports from other countries and have a well-rounded trade relation with them. "

From Wikipedia, we see that \"The UK has always been the biggest foreign investor in the US and vice versa.\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom%E2%80%93United_States_relations). This is referred to as the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK.\n\n- Japan and US have a near-zero correlation, despite their good economic ties. This can be explained by Japan's economic troubles over the past decade. (http://qz.com/198458/zombies-once-destroyed-japans-economy-now-theyre-infecting-chinas/)\n\n- European (excluding UK) countries are all very closely tied, with correlation near 1 between each pair.\n\n- Despite these close ties, the correlations between France and the Netherlands and the US are much lower than that of Germany and Sweden. Any idea of an explanation for this?\n\n- Generally, the US has much less of a dependence on foreign nations than other countries."
